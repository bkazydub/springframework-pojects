### Application functionality:
It is a simple online shop application with few roles: guest, registered client and admin. 

As client (both registered and guest) you can browse products, adding  them to your cart, making checkout, 
check order status etc.
If you are a guest you can create a new account.
As admin you're capable of managing products, etc.

The application can be started locally with `mvn tomcat7:run`.

Once a Tomcat server started you can access the shop at http://localhost:8080/shop/
